### What is a CSS Preprocessor?

A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends and is compiled into CSS.

### Which CSS Preprocessor should I use?

The 3 main preprocessors out right now are Less, Sass, and Stylus.  They all perform similarly, so often it is a matter of
personal preference on which syntax appeals to you or which you can develop faster with.

### Why would I want to use as CSS Preprocessor?  Couldn't I just write out the CSS?

You can write all the CSS that these preprocessors generate but it isn't very DRY.  We program to reduce complexity
and development time.  Writing in Sass allows you to modularize your CSS, perform mathematic operations, and automate
things like vendor prefixing and media-queries.

### What are the main features that makes these great?

* Mixins
* Variables
* Importing / including snippets
* Calculations
* Conditionals
* Much, much more!
